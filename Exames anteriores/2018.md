**a)** Message 1 - Alice sends a message do KDC saying that she wants to talk with Bob; Message 2 - KDC returns a message with the shared key (K<sub>A,B</sub>) encrypted with the private key K<sub>A,KDC</sub> that Alice shares with KDC. The same message is also sent to Bob.

**b)** Replay Attack - Consider Chuck has stolen one of Bob’s old keys by intercepting  an old response that the KDC has returned from previous conversation from Alice and Bob.

Chuck waits for the next request from Alice to set up a conversation with Bob, at this time he replays the old intercepted response as he knows the old key from the previous conversation.This way she can fool Alice into thinking she is Bob.

To avoid this we can add a nonce the content of the shared key, a nonce is a very large  random number chosen from a set with the intent of correlating two messages to each other.
